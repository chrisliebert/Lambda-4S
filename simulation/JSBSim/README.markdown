# JSBSim Output

We want to compare the output of JSBSim to the charts found in the original papers.

First  we start with an overview of the first three stage's altitude, velocity, and acceleration time histories.

## First Stage Thrust

An earlier text had the first stage thrust profile of Lambda-4S-2.
