# JSBSim

JSBSim is an open source flight dynamics model software. It is essentially the physics/math model that defines the movement of an aircraft, rocket, etc., under the forces and moments applied to it using the various control mechanisms and from the forces of nature.

Here I'm using it to recreate the trajectory of Lambda-4S-5 orbital flight.
