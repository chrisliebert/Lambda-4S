<p>The <strong>Lambda-4S Rocket</strong> (L-4Sロケット) was an experimental Japanese orbital launch vehicle. It is to-date the smallest orbital rocket ever launched. In 1970 it carried a small test satellite (a radio and temperature sensor) to an imprecise elliptical Earth orbit. It’s history starts with one person, Hideo Itokawa who started what would become the Japanese space program at the University of Tokyo.</p>

    <h2 id="hideo-itokawa">Hideo Itokawa</h2>

    <p>The story of the Japanese space program starts with Hideo Itokawa (糸川 英夫). Itokawa was born in Tokyo July 20th, 1912. As a young child he seemed fascinated with flight <a href="#Matogawa2007">(Matogawa, 2007)</a>. When Itokawa was 14 Charles Lindbergh made the first nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic. Itokawa was disappointed of the news, dreaming of being the first himself. Not too easily discouraged he made up his mind to be the first to cross the Pacific instead. (He did not, this was accomplished by <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/10/1005first-nonstop-transpacific-flight/">Clyde Pangborn in 1931</a>).</p>

    <p>Nevertheless he enrolled in the School of Aeronautical Science at the University of Tokyo in 1932. He graduated in 1935 writing his dissertation on the problem of the sound barrier <a href="#spacepowers">(<i>Emerging Space Powers</i>, 2010, p. 3)</a>. By the 30’s Japan was brandishing imperial power in the Pacific, having already started invading Northeast China (Manchuria). Itokawa applied to the officer corps of the Imperial Japanese Army, but was turned down due to poor health. Instead, under advice of a professor he joined the <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/airplane/museum/nakajima/naka-cont-e.html">Nakajima Aircraft Company (中島飛行機株式会社)</a>. While less famous in the West than Mitsubishi, Nakajima designed and built many aircraft for Japan during World War II. Itokawa and Yasuni Kayama led the development of the <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/airplane/museum/cl-pln3/TH030.html">Ki-43 <em>Hayabusa</em></a> (隼, Japanese word for a falcon) — A single engine fighter manufactured by the thousands.</p>

    <p>After the war American occupied Japan was forbidden from building aircraft or rockets. Itokawa, age 33, took a position at medical school at the University of Tokyo working on medical scanners. In 1949 he completed a doctoral thesis on the acoustic qualities of the flute and violin (acoustic modeling). Afterwards he developed a meter for measuring anesthesia and in 1953 he was invited to the United States as a guest lecturer for 6 months at the University of Chicago.</p>

    <p>This trip was a turning point for Itokawa’s. While vising the US he saw the rapid progress the nascent American space program was making. When he returned to the University of Tokyo talked to the director of the Institute of Industrial Science Shouji Hoshiai, about building rockets. Still thinking about trans-pacific flight he published a pop-science article in the Japanese daily newspaper Mainichi-Shimbun on high altitude flight with rockets.</p>

    <h2 id="avsa-and-the-pencil-rocket">AVSA And The Pencil Rocket</h2>

    <p>Itokawa built up support and attracted some attention from lots of young researchers at the Institute of Industrial Science. He wrote up an ambitious rocket plan describing a supersonic high altitude rocket plane to transport people over the Pacific in only 20 minutes. After a provisional meeting in December 1953 <a href="#JAXAPencil">(“Pencil Rocket Story,” n.d.)</a> a research group named <strong>“Avionics and Supersonic Aerodynamics”</strong> (AVSA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) was formed.</p>

    <p>The original goal of this group was to research and build the supersonic transpacific carrier. By 1952 Japan was once again a sovereign nation free to pursue research in aerospace. What was missing was money. Japan had not kept up with aerospace research around the world during the post-war reconstruction. Not that there was that much to keep up with. Very little had been published by the early 50’s. Almost all the work done by the US and the USSR was military and classified.</p>

    <p>Itokawa had to start from scratch. Despite it being standard textbook information now, even simple things like the relationship between fin area and center of mass location to rocket flight and dispersion probabilities were not well understood in the 1950’s. There was a strong need to work out the very basics first.</p>

    <blockquote><p>The smaller, the better. We have little money. If the propellant is small, we can burn many of them. The first task is to study how rockets fly. If the test rocket is small, we can test-fly easily. Let's launch small rockets as frequently as possible. These tiny fuels are just we have been looking for.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Hideo Itokawa</p><cite><a href="#Matogawa2007">(Matogawa, 2007)</a></cite></blockquote>
